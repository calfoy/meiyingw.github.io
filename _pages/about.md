# About me


I’m a researcher interested in behavioral and psychological studies. Currently, I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Marketing at London Business School. My research investigates how **reference points and counterfactual thinking** shape individual decisions and actions, particularly in consumer behaviors.
Before joining LBS, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Social Sciences (psychology) from University of Hong Kong and worked as a research assistant at ShanghaiTech University. I am very curious about the psychological precedents behind people’s behaviors, choices and judgments, and I hope to conduct some interesting research that might be informative or change-provoking!
