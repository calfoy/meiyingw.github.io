<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD candidate in management science at [ESADE business school](https://www.esade.edu/en) at Barcelona. My research focuses on understanding inter-temporal decisions in the workplace. My dissertation examines how undesirable precedents affect current and future decisions in workplace settings and negotiations. I am also interested in research methods.

In my free time, I like to learn new things. Recently I learned surfskating and tennis.
