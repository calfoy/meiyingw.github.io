# About me

Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD candidate in Management Science at [ESADE Business School](https://www.esade.edu/en) at Barcelona. My research focuses on understanding decisions over time (i.e., inter-temporal decisions) in the workplace. My dissertation studies undesirable precedents in negotiations. I am also interested in research methods. 

<br>

I have studied in China, Spain, the US, and the UK. During my PhD, I spent six months as a visiting PhD student at London Business School during the 2023-2024 academic year.

<br>

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new skills and activities that I didn't have the opportunity to learn earlier in life. Recently, I've taken up surfskating and tennis, both of which challenge me to stay focused and agile.

<br>
